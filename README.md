# UART-Universal-Asynchronous-Reciever-Transmitter

### -In this repo I Implemented universal asynchronous reciever transmitter using verilog hardware description language, generate a gate-level netlist using synopsys tool and make dft and formal verification to check equivalence between RTL and post-dft netlist scripted by TCL.


### -UART is used in a wide range of applications, including connecting microcontrollers to sensors, communicating with peripherals like GPS modules and Bluetooth modules, and for debugging and configuring devices during development.
